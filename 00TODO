 - After loading Spec256 snapshot the emulator freezes for some time
   (possibly dependent on time elapsed before doing that)
 - Full screen does not work in Windows - need to select the right depth &
   resolution (probing, enumeration, manual setting?)

- determine if it's possible to prevent blocking the application

  tooltip on system button opening) is in progress (Windows)?
